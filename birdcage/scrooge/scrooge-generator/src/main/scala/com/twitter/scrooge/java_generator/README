- Scrooge does not support default struct values right now since it can't parse the map into a struct in the TypeParser
  If we fix this, we need to fix PrintConstController
- struct metadata does not support retrieving the name for the typedef
- Need to implement generate_javadoc
- gen_hash_code_ not supported
- annotations_ (is_final) not supported
- unions not supported
- oneway functions in the parser code
