# scala-json [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/twitter/scala-json.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twitter/scala-json)

This library is deprecated! It should not be used for new projects, and is
maintained only because it is used in
[Twitter's Ostrich 9.x](https://github.com/twitter/ostrich).

This project is a toolkit for working with JSON in Scala that is based on
[example code](http://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_2ed/examples/)
from [Programming in Scala](http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala_2ed)
by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners. We've tightened up some edge
cases and added complete test coverage.
