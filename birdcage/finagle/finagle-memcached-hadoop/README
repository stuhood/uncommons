This package provides a MemcachedOutputFormat for use with Hadoop.  This 
outputformat can be configured like any other output format, plus one 
additional step:

    MemcachedOutputFormat.setFactory(job.getConfiguration(), factory);
        
Factory can be any class that implements 
com.twitter.finagle.memcached.SerializableKeyValueClientFactory.  There are two
reference factories: SimpleMemcachedClientFactory (which uses Ketama hashing), 
and PooledMemcachedClientFactory which updates all of a set of other clients.  
Scala constructors are: 
    
    new SimpleMemcachedClientFactory(hosts: Seq[String], 
                                     port: Int)
    new PooledMemcachedClient(clients: Seq[SerializableKeyValueClientFactory])
    
Java constructors are:

    new SimpleMemcachedClientFactory(List<String> hosts, 
                                     int port)
    new PooledMemcachedClient(List[SerializableKeyValueClientFactory] clients)
