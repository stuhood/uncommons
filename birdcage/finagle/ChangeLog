1.7.4		2011/07/22

	* http: convert codec exceptions into 4xx errors; report them
	as such upstream
	* memcache: `gets' and `cas' support.

1.7.3		2011/07/19

	* fix: 1.7.2 introduced a regression in the pool that may,
	under certain circumstances, admit connections beyond the high
	watermark.
	* quench exception for setting multiple Promise values when
	racing with write errors.
	* Adds tracing support for the Memcached client.  This only
	creates the client side annotations, no support for passing
	along ids and such to the memcached server.


1.7.2		2011/07/18

	* support end-to-end cancellation in finagle clients; fixes
	possible pool starvation conditions, and allows clients to
	cancel requests and reclaim resources
	* end-to-end timeouts: introduce, .connectTimeout and
	.timeout.  .connectTimeout is the end-to-end connection
	timeout (includes acquisition & TCP time), .timeout is an
	end-to-end request time: no requests will take longer
	* some doc fixes
	* misc. bug fixes
