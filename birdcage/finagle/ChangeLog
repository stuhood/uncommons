	grabby-hands replacements) using Offer/Broker
	* kestrel: don't render timeouts > 2^31-1
	* tracing: fix sampling bug
	* tracing: trace the kestrel client
	* quench unecessary error reporting

1.8.0		2011/08/02

	* SSL: perform hostname validation in the client.  this is the
	reason for the minor bump: we change the .tls() ClientBuilder
	signature
	* introduce util-codec dependency for use of the apache
	commons base 64 codec

1.7.5		2011/07/29

	* make it easier to use the NullStatsReceiver from java
	* convert WriteException to a case class (github issue 25)
	* add _root_. to java.util.Map import. reorder imports
	* Upgrade finagle-common-stats to twitter-common-stats 0.0.16
	* encode more HTTP codec errors
	* adding cardinality to ServiceException
	* finagle CachingPool: limit size to highWatermark - lowWatermark
	* exception reporting: gzipping trace strings
	* set ostrich version of finagle-ostrich4 to 4.7.3
	* ChannelServiceFactory: encode exceptions from bootstrap.connect()

1.7.4		2011/07/22

	* http: convert codec exceptions into 4xx errors; report them
	as such upstream
	* memcache: `gets' and `cas' support.

1.7.3		2011/07/19

	* fix: 1.7.2 introduced a regression in the pool that may,
	under certain circumstances, admit connections beyond the high
	watermark.
	* quench exception for setting multiple Promise values when
	racing with write errors.
	* Adds tracing support for the Memcached client.  This only
	creates the client side annotations, no support for passing
	along ids and such to the memcached server.


1.7.2		2011/07/18

	* support end-to-end cancellation in finagle clients; fixes
	possible pool starvation conditions, and allows clients to
	cancel requests and reclaim resources
	* end-to-end timeouts: introduce, .connectTimeout and
	.timeout.  .connectTimeout is the end-to-end connection
	timeout (includes acquisition & TCP time), .timeout is an
	end-to-end request time: no requests will take longer
	* some doc fixes
	* misc. bug fixes
